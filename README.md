# point_packing_python_c
The goal with this project was increasing the performance of my [point-packing](https://github.com/hojmax/Point-Packing) code. Instead of Javascript, the computation is now done in C with openmp, and the visualization is done in Python with PyGame. In order to run the project run ```
python3 draw.py```. Try clicking and dragging the mouse for repulsion.
