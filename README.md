# Point Packing
The goal of this project was increasing the performance of my [point-packing code](https://github.com/hojmax/Point-Packing). Instead of Javascript, the computation is now done in C with openmp, and the visualization is done in Python with PyGame. In order to run the project run `
python3 draw.py`. Try clicking and dragging the mouse for repulsion. Press **R** to reset the points. You can try different setups by changing the settings in `points.py`.
